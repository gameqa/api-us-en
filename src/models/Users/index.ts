 * This means that admins can be players as well.
 *
 * The model contains information regarding authentication,
 * as well as statistics on the users playtime, including
 * the number of rounds completed by task type
 *
 * @param {string} username - the users chosen username, must be unique
 * @param {string} email - the users email. Must be both valid and unique
 * @param {string} password the users password. This value must be passed in as unhashed. Hashing
 *     will happen in a pre-save hook.
 * @param {Types.ObjectId} invitedBy - deprecated: the user who invited this user
 * @param {Types.ObjectId[]} invites - deprecated: the users that have been invited by this user
 * @param {boolean | undefined} hasCompletedTutorial - deprecated: no tutorial present in front end, redundant attribute
 * @param {UserTypes} type - SET BY DEFAULT BY MODEL. This parameter can not and should not be
 *     passed in to the constructor. The type of the user, f.x. 'admin', 'not-verified', 'user'
 *     the user type will be set to 'not-verified' by default when created, and will be set to user
 *     when the user verifies via auth code
 * @param {number} questionCount - SET BY DEFAULT BY MODEL. This parameter can not and should not
 *     be passed in to the constructor. Total number of questions created by the user (set to 0)
 * @param {number} answerCount - SET BY DEFAULT BY MODEL. This parameter can not and should not be
 *     passed in to the constructor. Total number of answer spans marked by user
 * @param {number} verifyAnswerCount - SET BY DEFAULT BY MODEL. This parameter can not and should not be
 *     passed in to the constructor. Total number of answer spans verified by the user
 * @param {number} verifyQuestionCount - SET BY DEFAULT BY MODEL. This parameter can not and should not be
 *     passed in to the constructor. Total number of questions verified by the user
 * @param {number} articlesFoundCount - SET BY DEFAULT BY MODEL. This parameter can not and should not be
 *     passed in to the constructor. Total number of articles found by user
 * @param {string} verificationCode - SET BY DEFAULT BY MODEL. This parameter can not and should not be
 *     passed in to the constructor. This is a code that is generated randomly, sent to the user
 *     via email which he must enter in order to be able to play the game. This code is stored in a
 *     hashed state.
 * @param {number} hiscoreRank - SET BY DEFAULT BY MODEL. This parameter can not and should not be
 *     passed in to the constructor. Hiscore rank is the users current rank on the hiscore. This number
 *     is updated periodically by a chron task but on the creation of a user we estimate that a users
 *     is last on the hiscore.
 * @param {number} level - SET BY DEFAULT BY MODEL. This parameter can not and should not be
 *     passed in to the constructor. The level is set to default as level 1. When the user completes
 *     a game round, each time, the level is incremented by +1
 * @param {boolean} allowEmail - true if the user allows a promotional email to be sent his or hers way
 * @param {string[]} pushNotificationTokens - an array of push notification tokens for mobile app users
 * @param {boolean} shadowBanned - SET BY DEFAULT BY MODEL. This parameter can not and should not be
 *     passed in to the constructor. If a user is shadow banned then his contributions to the data gathering
 *     process will be ignored, but he can still continue on playing and level up, none the wiser.
 * @param {string} lastDateActive - SET BY DEFAULT BY MODEL. This parameter can not and should not be
 *     passed in to the constructor. This is a string in the form of 'yyyy-MM-dd' which is used to keep
 *     track of login streaks.
 * @param {dailyStreak} number  - SET BY DEFAULT BY MODEL. This parameter can not and should not be
 *     passed in to the constructor. This is the number of days this user has been logged in

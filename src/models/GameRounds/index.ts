/**
 * GameRounds is a collection that keeps tracks of
 * rounds during users playtime in the app. A pivotal
 * feature of this model is the fact that only one
 * game round can be active per user, that means that
 * the active game round saves the users progress in
 * the app.
 *
 *
 * @param {Types.ObjectId} userId the user that owns the game round
 *
 * @param {number} totalRounds CALCULATED BY MODEL, this value can not and
 *     should not be passed into the model. This is he total number of rounds to
 *     complete in this game round. Completing 'totalRounds' many rounds
 *     results in a user LVL-up.
 *
 * @param {number} currentRound CALCULATED BY MODEL, this value can not and
 *     should not be passed into the constructor. This is the current round
 *     of the user. Having currentRound < totalRounds signals that this game
 *     round is active (not completed). Is set to 1 as default
 *
 * @param {Date | undefined} completedAt CALCULATED BY MODEL, this value can
 *     not and should not be passed into the constructor. This is undefined
 *     for any inactive gameround but will be set to 'Date.now()' when the last
 *     round is completed.

/**
 *
 * The Answers model keeps track of an answer for a specific
 * question. Each answer belongs to only one question, but a
 * question can in fact have many answers. An answer is created
 * when an article is found that countains the answer. The answer
 * also contains more meta data. Which includes start of answer
 * span, end of answer span, is it a yes or no question and so on
 *
 *
 * @param {Types.ObjectId} questionId - Question which this answer is
 *     created to answer.
 *
 * @param {Types.ObjectId} creationRoundId - the game round in which
 *     this answer was created. An answer is created in the google
 *     search phase so the round in which this answer was googled.
 *
 * @param {Types.ObjectId} createdBy - _id of user which found the
 *     answer in the Google search phase
 *
 * @param {Types.ObjectId} articleId - _id of the article in which the
 *     user (who found the answer) has chosen as a candidate to answer
 *     this question
 *
 * @param {number} paragraphIndex - the index of the paragraph which
 *    the user (who found the answer) has chosen as a candidate inside
 *    the article to answer this question. If the article contains N
 *    paragraphs, then this number can range from 0 to N-1
 *
 * @param {number | undefined} firstWord - SET BY DEFAULT BY MODEL. This
 *     parameter can not and should not be passed in to the constructor.
 *     firstWord is by default set to undefined. In the select span step
 *     a user will submit the first word which will update this field in
 *     the resource
 *
 * @param {number | undefined} lastWord - SET BY DEFAULT BY MODEL. This
 *     parameter can not and should not be passed in to the constructor.
 *     lastWord is by default set to undefined. In the select span step
 *     a user will submit the last word which will update this field in
 *     the resource
 *
 * @param {Date | undefined} answeredAt - Answered is set as new Date()
 *     whenever an answer span is selected or a yes/no answer has been
 *     chosen for a yes/no question
 *
 * @param {Date | undefined} verifiedAt - SET BY DEFAULT BY MODEL. This
 *     parameter can not and should not be passed in to the constructor.
 *     When an answer (with a span or defined yes/no answer) has been
 *     verified a certain number of times by users the verifiedAt will be
 *     set as new Date()
 *
 * @param {boolean | undefined} archived - an answer is not archived by
 *     default. When a user is tasked by marking the span, answering yes/no
 *     or verifying the span or yes/no he has the option to say that the
 *     answer is incorrect or that it isn't present. When he does so
 *     the answer is marked as archivd.
 *
 * @param {boolean | undefined} canBeShortened - deprecated: original intention
 *     was to allow users to mark that an answer span is 'too wordy'. Due
 *     to problems with incorperating this into the front end this was
 *     in the end abandoned. This field is although still being set / updated.
 *     However, this field will not be included in the dataset gathered.
 *
 * @param {boolean | undefined} yesOrNoAnswer - if the question connected to
 *     this answer is a yes/no question the yesOrNoAnswer can be set to
 *     either true or false. True means that the answer to the question
 *     is 'yes', false on the other hand signifies that the answer to the
 *     question is 'no'.
 *
 * @param {boolean | undefined} isDisqualified - this field can be thought
 *     of as meaning that the answer should not be included in the final
 *     dataset. In this sense, we can think of 'archived' as a preamble
 *     to being 'isDisqualified'. 'archived' is marked by the user, and an
 *     admin could possibly verify the 'archived' status by making the
 *     answer 'isDisqualified', if the admin does not agree with the user
 *     the admin could decide to remove the 'archive' status and thus making
 *     the answer valid again.
 *
 * @param {Date | undefined} seenByQuestionerAt - undefined by default but
 *     set to new Date() as soon as the person who wrote the question (which
 *     this answer is set to create) sees the answer.
